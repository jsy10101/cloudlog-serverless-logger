# cloudlog-serverless-logger

A faultâ€‘tolerant, serverless log aggregation pipeline built with **AWS Lambda**, **Amazon SQS**, and **CloudWatch**.  
Designed to ingest, queue, process, and store application logs at scaleâ€”while providing robust retry logic, deadâ€‘letter queues, and centralized observability for productionâ€‘grade diagnostics.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

-   **AWS Lambda (Python 3.9)** â€“ serverless compute for ingestion and processing
-   **Amazon SQS + Deadâ€‘Letter Queue** â€“ reliable, decoupled message buffering with builtâ€‘in retries
-   **Amazon S3** â€“ durable, costâ€‘effective storage for processed logs
-   **Amazon CloudWatch** â€“ metrics, logs, alarms, and dashboards for observability
-   **Infrastructure as Code** â€“ AWS SAM (or Terraform) for reproducible deployments
-   **Local Development** â€“ Serverless Framework or SAM CLI for offline testing
-   **CI/CD** â€“ GitHub Actions for automated build & deployment

## ðŸš€ MVP Roadmap

### v0.1 â€“ Log Ingestor

-   Define an HTTP endpoint to receive raw log payloads
-   Implement **log_ingestor** Lambda to validate and enqueue messages into SQS
-   Configure a primary SQS queue with a Deadâ€‘Letter Queue for failed deliveries
-   Emit a basic ingestion metric (`IngestedLogCount`) to CloudWatch

### v0.2 â€“ Processor & Storage

-   Add **log_processor** Lambda to batchâ€‘read from SQS and persist logs to S3
-   Publish processing metrics (`ProcessedLogCount`, `ProcessingErrors`) to CloudWatch
-   Configure DLQ redrive policy and alarm on queue depth
-   Assemble a CloudWatch dashboard to visualize ingestion vs. processing rates and error trends

## ðŸ“– Initial Roadmap (beyond v0.2)

-   **v0.3** â€“ Alerts & CI/CD

    -   Define CloudWatch alarms for SLA breaches and error thresholds
    -   Automate deployments with GitHub Actions

-   **v0.4** â€“ Query Interface

    -   Develop a simple UI or CLI for querying recent log entries or S3 partitions

-   **v0.5** â€“ Advanced Analytics
    -   Integrate with Grafana/OpenSearch for fullâ€‘featured log exploration and anomaly detection.

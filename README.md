# cloudlog-serverless-logger

A fault-tolerant, serverless log aggregation system built with **AWS Lambda**, **Amazon SQS**, and **CloudWatch**.  
This project ingests and processes logs from distributed services using **retry logic**, **dead-letter queues**, and centralized monitoringâ€”enabling diagnostics for production-grade applications in real-world infrastructure environments.
